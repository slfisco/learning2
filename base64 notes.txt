Encoding:
binary is 8 bits
positions have base values: 2^7, 2^6, 2^5, 2^4, 2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^0 or 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

base64 is 6 bits corresponding to 64 characters

A is ascii code 65
- 65 in binary is 01000001
- this is 64 + 1

for base64, take binary and divide it into 6 bit groups
any extra bits become ==
CAT is ascii code 67, 65, 84
in 8 bit binary this is
01000011,01000001,01010100
in base64 this is:
010000,110100,000101,010100
aka 16, 52, 5, 20

hexadecimal is similar but in groups of 4
let's try this
01000011,01000001,01010100
0100-0011-0100-0001-0101-0100
4,3,4,1,5,4
434154

python has built in hashing library hashlib
python also has built in encoding decoding - to convert from hex to base64
